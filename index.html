            <h5 class=bio-title>Who I am?</h5>
            <p class="bio-text">Amalia May is a multi-ethnic, award-winning actress and writer who grew up in both Tel Aviv, Israel and in Miami, Florida. 
                She is often cast as a seductive villain, a femme fatale, a powerhouse lawyer or the bad girl next door. A trained dancer, Amalia is also known for the physicality she brings to her roles – whether it’s dancing Argentine Tango, Salsa, Belly-dance, or pole dancing. 
                
                Soon after graduating from school in Miami, Amalia moved to New York City. In New York, she got the opportunity to study Meisner Technique with the late Robert X. Modica, the former teaching assistant to Sanford Meisner himself. While living in New York, Amalia worked and performed at The Looking Glass Theater in Manhattan, and in many independent films that helped her hone her craft as an actor. In 2015, she started studying screenwriting at the respected Gotham Writers Workshop in NYC. 
                
                In 2016, she filmed the comedic web series “Without a Hitch”, which she wrote, produced and co-starred in, alongside legendary Peruvian actress, Teresa Yenque. 
                The series was proudly featured in a story by NBC Latino upon its release and premiered at the Miami Web Series festival, winning “Best Screenplay”.
                
                Last year, Amalia starred in the short film, “The First Time”, based on a script that she wrote. The film is currently in editing and is expected to be released later this year. Earlier this year, she wrote, directed and acted in a short quarantine film, “Jump”, which was selected as part of Short of the Week’s Shelter Shorts online Festival. 
                Amalia’s pilot script, “Strip Mom”, has been making the rounds of competitions this year, being named a finalist at the Austin Film Festival’s 2020 Pitch Competition and recently becoming a quarterfinalist, advancing to the next round, in ScreenCraft’s TV Pilot Competition. 
                
                Amalia continues to work out as an actor when in between projects, taking ongoing classes virtually at the Lesly Kahn studio in Los Angeles. 
                
                Amalia divides her time between New York, Miami and LA, enjoying the opportunity to work in projects in all three cities. 
                
                Amalia is currently in pre-production for the film “One Percent” – a dark comedy, co-starring Emily Leguizamo. This film will be produced through Amalia’s film production company, Shoshana Films. Learn more about this project here.</p>
